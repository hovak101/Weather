# myCity
myCity is a weather website. When a location is entered, the temperature, humidity, five day forecast, and other information relating to the input location is displayed.

This website was created and presented by the "Anti Syntax Error Crew" as the final project for the 2022 Google Computer Science Summer Institute. Groups of 3 or 4 were 
given a time constraint of one week to brainstorm, build, and debug their website. This project was originally created using replit, but has since been moved to this git
repository. 

Group Members: Alex Hovakimyan, Chester Huey, Andrew Diep, Brian Huynh

NOTE: the google maps api may no longer work for you as it requires payment per request made and our balance in the requesting account is limited. Can be fixed by adding additional funds,
but this project is archived, so funds for the maps api are unlikely to be refilled.
